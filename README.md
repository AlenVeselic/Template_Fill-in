# Template_Fill-in
Synopsis:

  For this project I took a look at the Conquer template and filled it's filler content in with a ridiculous premise.

Full description:

  This project introduced me to bootstrap, so I had to do some research on what it is and what it does. For that I did some research using the tutorials on 
  W3Schools and some minor skimming on Youtube. I plan to study this framework more.

  In terms of the state of the project I have two things that leave me unsatisfied with the result:
    1) I didn't take full advantage of the functionality available to me which in turn doesn't do the simple task of filling in the page justice. By functionality, I mean giving a purpose to 
      the buttons and the form at the end.
    2) Because I was caught caught by suprise by it being a Bootstrap project, I feel like I should've played with the layout more and truly explored the framework's capabilities.

  Otherwise it was a good exercise in creative writing and a way of testing the waters of bootstrap and web development in general.

  Although there are only two error I see now, I feel like I might revisit and rework this project in the future.
  For now this is my first project of many to come, it might be a small and minor, maybe even mediocre step in the eyes of an experienced dev. But for me it's a huge one.

Thank you for reading this far, there are more projects to come!
