							<p class="feature-content-description">I've been living in this neighborhood for the past 3 years and he hasn't ever made contact with me. He doesn't even greet me or give me a glance of acknowldgement. I feel like a lowly peasant being judged by a menacing god whenever he hoses his grass and I take out the trash or go out to pick up my newspaper.

							<p class="feature-content-description">There are many cases when a neighbor's dog can be annoying, but I believe my case is especially obnoxious. This MUTT has to have a grudge against me, it keeps defecating on my lawn. It also seems to have memorized my shift changes at work so that it starts making noises only the devil could recognize. I can't sleep, night after night this hellspawn keeps me up. I've been thinking of moving out, because at this point I'm might be driven to something immoral. I keep warning James, but he keeps repeating the phrase "HAha yeeeeah Sparky's a special little pooch." and walks off to hose down his backyard. This is what my lawn looks like at this point. <a href="https://www.aaalawncare.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/skunk_damage_correct_size.jpg" target="_parent">Utterly defaced, honestly I'm embarrassed to invite friends to my place</a>. I could be overreacting and it may also be true. But any selfrespecting father has a tidy lawn and this...this is just disgraceful.</p>

							<p class="feature-content-description">Now you might not believe this. I mean nobody would, why would an innocent looking old man mess with someone and pull "innocent" pranks costing the other party hundreds of dollars in lawnmower blades. Yeah? Well this bloke started throwing rocks onto my property out with malicious intent. Whenever I mow the lawn I notice random rocks the size of a fist showing up on my lawn. Took about a year and 5 lawnmower blades for me to realise that these broken blades were no accident. Even caught him in the act one. I'm not going to share that here, cause he might be reading, but you can reach me on *insert fake mail here* for the details.

							<h2>The Hosing</h2>
							<p>The man hoses. He hoses in the morning, he hoses in the evening, he hoses throughout the entire day. What does he hose? Half the day he waters the grass on his front and backyard. When he reaches the backyard, he waters the garden. After he's done with plant life he attacks his driveway, hosing down the path leading to it and the platform itself of dirt and grime. I must wonder how big his water bill must be... After he's done hosing the world he puts away the hose and hoses his wife. Every Sunday. At 6:30pm right after their favorite crime drama ends. The sounds that man makes. I can feel each of my vertebrae shiver in disgust just thinking about it, hope I don't dislocate something.</p>

								<h2>Disappearing newspaper</h2>
								<p>I have a few magazine and news subscriptions, if I don't pick these up from the where the postman drops them off in front of my place, there's a good chance James's dog will come over, steal my entire collection of readables and take them over to James to peruse them at his leisure. <br> Now I have given him notice of the issue multiple times, he just doesn't care. I don't know if he doesn't want to scold his dog or if he actually taught it to steal my stuff. I will not stand for this much longer. This man has crossed me and there will be retribution! </p>

										<h2>Clear my head</h2>

										<p>Lately, my life has completely derailed thanks to James and his escapades. Maybe it would be better for my health to stop giving as much attention to him and dedicate this energy to finding activites I like.

I remain hesitant, this man has caused me so much grief that I cannot even bear to see him, much less have a civil conversation with him. One day I might get over this, but right now I more comfortable keeping a good distance.</p>

											<h2>The Verdict</h2>
											<p class="tm-box-p">I'm going to tackle this by focusing on myself and my own interests. I've lost too much time paying attention to James. Sure, he has caused me grief actively without payback. Vengeance seems meaningless at this point. It would only spark an actual rivalry which I know he wants. He's been watching those sitcoms and wants to cultivate such a relationship, but all he's getting is radio silence.</p>
											<p class="tm-box-p">To reinforce this I've been taking baby steps. I've been taking walks with friends and family members and I've also been doing some research on useful hobbies. Me and my wife have also taken up dance classes on Thursdays. So yeah, things are looking good right now. Good bye to those reading and thank you for reading this ventpage. Don't stray too far for there may be updates in the future!</p>
